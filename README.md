# Chatbot Integration for Website

This repository contains the code and setup instructions for integrating an AI-powered chatbot into your website. The chatbot leverages cutting-edge machine learning models to provide intelligent, real-time responses and is designed to be easily customizable for various use cases.

## Features
- **Advanced AI Model:** Powered by state-of-the-art transformer models for natural and coherent conversations.
- **High Performance:** Optimized using PyTorch and accelerated libraries for fast inference.
- **Web Integration:** Includes Flask-based backend for seamless integration with web applications.
- **Cross-Origin Compatibility:** CORS enabled for flexible deployment.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the chatbot environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Model Weights:**
   Make sure to download the necessary model weights as per your requirements using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. Example:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("model_name")
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("model_name")
   ```

4. **Run the Server:**
   Start the Flask application to serve the chatbot API.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Integrate with Your Website:**
   Use the provided API endpoints to integrate the chatbot with your website.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

1. **Chat Endpoint:**
   - URL: `/chat`
   - Method: `POST`
   - Payload: `{ "message": "Your input text" }`
   - Response: `{ "reply": "Chatbot's response" }`

### Customization
Modify the chatbot behavior by fine-tuning the model or adjusting the pipeline parameters in the `app.py` file.
